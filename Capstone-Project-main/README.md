# Group Capstone project for CS470
The project would be a time management system for businesses in which employees 
could check their schedules and log their time for working. It would also feature a management 
system for checking employee schedules, updating employee schedules and checking how many 
hours each employee has worked.

This would be a medium sized project in total, but shouldn't be too difficult to implement and create.

In total,

* It would have a time-table to track the days an employee works and a method to manually change this.

* Would record and perform either Weekly, Bi-weekly or Monthly payouts from one date range to another.

* It would reset the hours works after each pay period.

* Calculates timed work from clock-in and clock-out time.
